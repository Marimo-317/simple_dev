    <h3>Object model</h3>
    <p>
      Except as described below, the object module exposed should be similar to
      that exposed by Visual Basic, etc. Due to the nature of ActiveX Scripting,
      the details for each host are different, but Python should work
      "correctly".
    </p>

    <p>
      The object model exposed via Python for MSIE is not as seamless as VB. The
      biggest limitation is the concept of a "local" namespace. For example, in
      VB, you can code <code>text="Hi there"</code>, but in Python, you must
      code <code>MyForm.ThisButton.Text="Hi There"</code>. See the
      <a href="foo2.htm">foo2</a> sample for futher details.
    </p>

    <h3>Known bugs and problems</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          This release seems to have broken Aaron's mouse-trace sample. No idea
          why, and I'm supposed to be looking into it.
          <li>
            <p>
              Builtin objects such as MARQUEE are giving me grief. Objects
              accessed via forms are generally no problem.
              <li>
                <p>
                  If you are trying to use Python with the Windows Scripting
                  Host, note that .pys files are not correct registered - you
                  will need to explicitly specify either cscript.exe or
                  wscript.exe on the command line.
