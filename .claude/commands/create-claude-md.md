## Process

1. Scan project files and directories
2. Identify technology stack from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
3. Analyze existing configuration files
4. Detect coding patterns and conventions
5. Generate context-appropriate CLAUDE.md
6. Include project-specific agent recommendations

## Customization Options

- Language-specific templates (JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)
- Framework templates (React, Django, Express, etc.)
- Domain templates (web apps, CLI tools, libraries, etc.)
- Team size and workflow patterns
