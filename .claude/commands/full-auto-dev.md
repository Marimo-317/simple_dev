## Intelligent Decision Making

### Agent Selection Algorithm

```python
def select_agents(task_type, complexity, risk_level):
    base_agents = get_core_agents(task_type)

    if complexity > 7:
        base_agents.extend(get_specialist_agents(task_type))

    if risk_level == 'high':
        base_agents.extend(['security-auditor', 'architect-review'])

    return optimize_agent_coordination(base_agents)
```

### Quality Threshold Adjustment

```python
def adjust_quality_thresholds(risk_level, time_budget):
    base_thresholds = get_default_thresholds()

    risk_multiplier = {'low': 0.9, 'medium': 1.0, 'high': 1.1}[risk_level]
    time_factor = min(1.2, max(0.8, time_budget / 8))

    return apply_adjustments(base_thresholds, risk_multiplier, time_factor)
```

### Failure Recovery Logic

```python
def handle_quality_gate_failure(stage, failure_reason, attempt_count):
    if attempt_count >= 3:
        return escalate_to_human()

    if failure_reason in RETRYABLE_FAILURES:
        return retry_with_enhanced_parameters()

    if failure_reason in CRITICAL_FAILURES:
        return halt_and_escalate()

    return apply_remediation_strategy(failure_reason)
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Automatic Recovery Strategies

**Quality Gate Failures**:

- Retry with enhanced parameters (up to 3 attempts)
- Apply targeted remediation based on failure type
- Escalate to specialized agents for complex issues
- Fallback to human review for persistent failures

**Agent Failures**:

- Automatic failover to backup agents
- Task redistribution among available agents
- Partial completion with manual intervention prompts
- Graceful degradation with reduced functionality

**Environment Issues**:

- Automatic environment health checks
- Resource scaling and optimization
- Alternative deployment strategies
- Rollback to last known good state

### Human Escalation Triggers

- Quality gate failure after 3 automated attempts
- Security vulnerabilities above risk tolerance
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable limits
- Critical system failures or data corruption risks
- Time budget exceeded by more than 50%
