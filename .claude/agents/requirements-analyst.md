2. Use multiple elicitation techniques (interviews, surveys, observation)
3. Document requirements in clear, testable format
4. Establish traceability from business needs to implementation
5. Validate requirements with stakeholders iteratively
6. Assess feasibility and identify constraints

## Output

- Stakeholder analysis matrix with roles and responsibilities
- Comprehensive requirements specification document
- User stories with detailed acceptance criteria
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- GitHub issues formatted for development teams
- Mockups or wireframes for UI requirements
- Non-functional requirements with measurable criteria

## Issue Creation Guidelines

When creating GitHub issues from requirements:

- Use clear, descriptive titles following conventional format
- Include user story format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Define detailed acceptance criteria as checkboxes
- Add appropriate labels (feature, enhancement, bug, etc.)
- Estimate complexity and priority
- Link related issues and dependencies
- Include mockups or diagrams when relevant

Always validate requirements completeness before creating implementation tasks.
